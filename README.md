# Prototype_Arduino_CANSAT
- Prototype of CANSAT which will be launched on August 2021.
- Prototype of CANSAT which will be exhibited during Capstone Event on January 2021.

# Caution
'sketchs' must be executed with 'libraries' folder of Arduino.

# Missions

Satellite
- Read Pitch, Roll, Yaw(PRY) value and send it to Ground-Control.

Ground-Control
- Connect with Satellite by using Bluetooth or Wifi.
- Print the PRY value transmitted from Satellite.
- Draw the position of CANSAT using PRY value.
